    "title": "GPU-Based Real-Time Procedural Distribution of Vegetation on Procedural Virtual Terrains",
    "description": "This project is a Unity tool that allows for the real-time procedural distribution of vegetation on large-scale virtual terrains, with consideration of both abiotic and biotic factors from a heightmap. It does this by computing a moisture map and distributing vegetation in layers from largest to smallest plants, with the ability to adjust parameters such as moisture, temperature, and slope.",
